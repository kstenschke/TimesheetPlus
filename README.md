[![Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSL-blue.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE_1_0.txt)

## Zero Installation, No Dependencies

* The application consists from a single executable file
* No server or database needed: Timetracking entries are recorded directly to an HTML file
* No background processes: Starting a new entry just records the current time, than tictac-track gets out of your way
* A default configuration file is created on first run


Features
--------

* Works directly from CLI, on Linux and Mac OS (not tested on Windows)
* Stores all work entries into an HTML file, ready to be printed
* CLI viewer: The timesheet can be viewed pretty-printed user-friendly formatted, directly within CLI
* No external editor needed: Entries can be edited directly from CLI (start/end-time, comment, task)
* Task-reference and comments: Timesheet entries contain start- and end-time and optionally a task-number and comment
* Search filter: The CLI viewer can use search filters (by date, week, month, task-number, comment)
* Time sum calculation: Recorded work times are additionally summed: per entry / task per day / day / filtered view / in total
* Overtime saldo: Required vs. recorded work time per day is calculated automatically
* Timesheet entries can be merged, split and deleted from the commandline
* Automatic backup / undo option: Before modifications are done, a backup of the timesheet is recorded,
  every modification command can be undone. Note: currently only one previous command can be undone.
* Terminal color themes: There are several color presets built-in to support different terminal color palettes
* Export: Timesheets can be exported to a CSV file
* External URL-linking: Referenced items can be dynamically opened in web-browser: all tasks of a day / week / month
* Timesheet can be recorded in multiple languages (de, dk, en, es, fi, fr, hu, it, lv, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, ru, sv, tr)

## Commands in detail

### Command: start (s) - Add new entry to timesheet report

The new entry's status is set to ongoing. If a previous entry has been ongoing when a new entry is started,
the previous entry is being stopped, with the current time being recorded as that task's end-time.
For the first entry per day, a default task number to be used when none is given, can be configured in ttt.ini.

#### Usage examples:

`s`           - Start a new entry (w/o task-no. or comment) at the current time

`s Foo`       - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo"

`s "Foo bar"` - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo bar"

`s Foo 123`   - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo" and task number: 123

`s 123`       - Start task 123 w/o comment

`s 3 08:30`   - Update start-time of entry 3 to 08:30

`s i=3 08:30` - Update start-time of entry 3 to 08:30


### Command: stop / pause (p) - Stop ongoing entry, storing current time as end-time

#### Usage examples:

`p`           - End currently ongoing entry, store current time as end-time

`p Foo`       - End currently ongoing entry, append "Foo" to it's comment, store current time as end-time

### Command: resume (r) - Resumes last or given entry (starts a new entry w/ same task and comment)

If the given argument is no existing ID, but there is an entry w/ such a task number, the system suggests to resume the
