## Commands in detail

### Command: start (s) - Add new entry to timesheet report

The new entry's status is set to ongoing. If a previous entry has been ongoing when a new entry is started,
the previous entry is being stopped, with the current time being recorded as that task's end-time.
For the first entry per day, a default task number to be used when none is given, can be configured in ttt.ini.

#### Usage examples:

`s`           - Start a new entry (w/o task-no. or comment) at the current time

`s Foo`       - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo"

`s "Foo bar"` - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo bar"

`s Foo 123`   - Start a new entry commented w/ "Foo" and task number: 123

`s 123`       - Start task 123 w/o comment

`s 3 08:30`   - Update start-time of entry 3 to 08:30

`s i=3 08:30` - Update start-time of entry 3 to 08:30


### Command: stop / pause (p) - Stop ongoing entry, storing current time as end-time

#### Usage examples:

(".ttt.ini" in the path of the executable), which can than be edited. 
The following options are available:

* `report_path`: Path where the timesheet is stored (if not specified: path where the application executable is) 
* `locale`: Language for calendaric and other labels (day, date, week, etc.).
  The following languages are built-in:
  German (de), Danish (dk), English (en), Spanish (es), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it),

* `default_daily_start_time`: Default daily starting time. Used for insertion of all-day entries. Format: HH:MM
* `first_task_of_day`: Task number to be used for the first entry per day, when no other task-no. is given.
* `max_mergeable_minutes_gap`: Maximum mergeable time gap between two entries, allowed to be merged. Prevents accidentally removing lunch breaks.
* Arbitrary commands for opening URLs of other project-management tools, e.g. `url.edit` / `url.log` / ...
* `clear_before_view`: Clears console before printing timesheet
* `cli_theme`: Theme for commandline timesheet viewer. There are several color themes built-in, allowing to view timesheets
  with various different color palettes in different CLI applications (bash, terminal, etc.).
